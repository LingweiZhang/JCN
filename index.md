## Welcome to Journal Club with specialization in Neuroscience

Journal Club with specialization in Neuroscience (JCR) is an in-the-flash activity of FDU URPB (Undergraduate Research Program in Biology). Each week, an undergraduate student in FDU will share others with recent research or independent projects about neuroscience.
